Welcome to Pokédex, a project developed for a university course on mobile app development using React Native. This app is a hobby project of mine to explore developing a mobile application and provides a platform to explore information about various Pokémon. 

## Features 

- **List of all the Pokémons:** Browse through a list of all Pokémon with pagination support.   
- **Details Page:** View detailed information about a Pokémon, including stats and types.   
- **Search Functionality:** Search for a Pokémon by name.   
- **Favorites:** Mark your favorite Pokémon, utilizing local storage with Expo SecureStore.  
- **Pleasant UI:** Designed with React Native Paper for an enhanced user experience.
